## Calculate Months Until Loan Is Paid

I don't think the formula provided in the book is correct. I spent time trying
to find the correct formula. So while the code works, the answer is incorrect.

### Usage

```
$ ruby 26-months-to-pay-off-credit-card.rb
What is your credit card balance? 5000
What is the APR on the card (as a percent)? 12
What is the monthly payment you will make? 100
It will take you -3.573062372113287 months # Obviously not correct
```
